# Pipelines

File structure and scripts for generating phylogenetic trees using `supersmartR` packages.

`0_base` introduces the main components of a pipeline and builds a gene for a taxonomic group.
Subsequent pipelines (`1_`, `2_`, ...) build on this base for more complex phylogenetic approaches.
